        <h3>METHOD</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Fillet the fish and cut into bite-sized pieces, or leave them whole if small. Scrub the shellfish and clean as appropriate. <br> <br>
            Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the onion and garlic, and fry gently to soften. Add the tomato paste diluted with a little water, or the fresh tomatoes, and a pinch of chilli. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. <br><br>
            Start to add the large pieces of fish to the sauce first, followed by the shellfish and then by the small fish. Cook gently for 5â€“8 minutes, or until the fish is cooked and the mussels and clams have opened, then add the parsley and wine vinegar. Toss gently to mix. <br><br>
            Serve with toasted bread, which you either put at the bottom of the plate or offer separately. I always add a little stream of extra virgin olive oil on top for flavour.</p>
