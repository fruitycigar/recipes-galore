        <h3>METHOD</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>1.Clean the turnip greens: discard the external larger leaves and the stalks. With the help of a sharp knife, remove the soft leaves and the florets; <br><br>
            2.Properly rinse them under running water, dry them, and put them aside; <br><br>
            3.Fill a large stockpot with plenty of salted water and bring to a boil;<br><br>
            4.When the water boils, add the turnip greens and cook for 5 minutes;<br><br>
            5.Toast the breadcrumbs until golden over medium heat in a pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil;<br><br>
            6.Rinse the anchovies under running water to wash off the salt and oil;<br><br>
            7.In another pan heat the remaining oil, add the red pepper flakes, the unpeeled garlic clove, and the anchovy fillets. Sauté over medium-low heat; otherwise; the high temperature will make the oil and the anchovies bitter. 8.Simmer it very very slowly;<br><br>
            9.Stir with a wooden spoon until the anchovy fillets have melted; Cook for a few minutes, remove from the heat, and discard the garlic. If you are vegan, you can add black olive paste as a substitute for the anchovy;<br><br>
            10.After the turnip greens have cooked for 5 minutes, add the orecchiette and follow the cooking time on the package; stir gently; <br><br>
            11.When done, drain orecchiette with the turnip greens; remember to save a scoop of cooking water: you may need it in case the sauce gets too thick. Pour them into the pan with the anchovy sauce;<br><br>
            12.Sauté gently and season with salt;<br><br>
            13.Taste it and see if it needs some more oil;<br><br>
            14.Remove it from the heat, place the orecchiette in bowls, and top with a drizzle of olive oil and the toasted breadcrumbs. This is a special dish that you must share with your family;</p>
