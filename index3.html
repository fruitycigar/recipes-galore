        <h3>METHOD</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Clean and dry the spinach leaves. Peel and crush the garlic clove. <br>
            Heat the olive oil in a large pan and brown the garlic. Remove the garlic and add the spinach leaves. Cover and cook, medium heat, until the spinach wilts (about 3-4 minutes). <br>
            Place the spinach on a strain and remove as much liquid as possible (help yourself by pressing the leaves with a tablespoon). <br>
            Mash spinach with a blender or hand blender (just a few seconds). <br> <br>
            Pour the ricotta cheese in a large bowl. Add spinach and mix well. Add salt, black pepper, nutmeg, parmesan cheese, egg (beaten) and flour. Mix well with a wood spoon. Let rest about 5 minutes. <br>
            Place 3-4 tablespoons of flour in a bowl. Use your hands to form a 2-3 inches ball of the spinach-ricotta mixture, place it in the flour bowl and flour it completely. Place the ball on a piece of parchment paper. Repeat until you finish the mixture. <br>
            Place butter and sage leaves in a large pan and melt over a low heat. <br><br>
            Fill a medium-size pot with water, add a teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil. Carefully place gnudi, one at the time, in the boiling water. As soon as the balls come to the surface, take them from the water using a skimmer and place them in the pan with the melted butter. Season gnudi carefully, by moving the pan in delicate circular movements. <br>
            Sprinkle gnudi with grated parmesan and serve them hot.</p>
